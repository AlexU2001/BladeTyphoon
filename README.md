# BladeTyphoon
Blade Typhoon is a game where you have blades swirling around you like a storm.

## Narrative
You are a natural disaster that has fallen on an alien planet. Run amock and grow in power and force as you do. The residents will try to stop you but how can one block a storm?

## Gameplay
Move around and user your blades to kill enemies. Enemies will drop power ups that will greatly increase your battle prowess.

## Idea Corner
The enemies will have different rankings in their alien society and go about their business as usual until they spot the player. They'll then go into a mix of states which will determine their actions.

Lower ranks are less likely to take on aggressive behavior.
